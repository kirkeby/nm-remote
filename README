Command-line scripts to control NetworkManager.

Right now there are all of two:

 * list; lists all user-defined connections.
 * vpn; controls VPN connections, 'vpn on -f foo' tells NetworkManager to
   connect the first VPN connection having a name matching foo.
   'vpn off' disconnects VPN connections.
