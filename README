Command-line scripts to control NetworkManager.

Right now there are all of two:

 * list; lists all user-defined connections.
 * vpn; controls VPN connections, 'vpn on foo' tells NetworkManager to connect
   the first VPN connection with a name matching foo. 'vpn off foo'
   disconnects VPN connections.
